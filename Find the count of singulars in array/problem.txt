Consider data with assorted details of socks pair IDs. Each element in the array represents a number of similar pairs. You will have to find out how many singular socks are present which do not have any pair left.

Sample input: arrNum = {10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 30, 50, 10, 20}

Output: Count of singular socks = 3

Explanation : Socks Id - 10: total count 4 => Two pairs of socks - no singular left

Socks Id - 20: total count 3 => One pair of socks - 1 singular left

Socks Id - 30: total count 1 => No pair of socks - 1 singular left

Socks Id - 50: total count 1 => No pair of socks - 1 singular left

So, Total number of Singular socks = 3
